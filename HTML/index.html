           <p>
            Few people follow a healthy diet and continue with it, often because of the difficulty of 
            preparation or the scarcity of finding ingredients, 
            and purchasing healthy meals can be expensive for some people. This site offers healthy, quick and easy 
            recipes that suit all categories and are not expensive, and users can 
            also share their healthy recipes to benefit others.
